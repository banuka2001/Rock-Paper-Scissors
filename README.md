Simple JavaScript project Rock, Paper, Scissors game

---- I have used below theories in the project ----

1. Object Lookup

used winConditions object for winner determination.

2. Higher-Order Functions

Used arrow functions (randomNumber, computerInput).

3. Ternary Logic

Compared winConditions to decide wins (computer/user) without redundant checks.

4. Type Coercion

Normalized inputs to uppercase (toUpperCase()) for case-insensitive comparisons.

5. Switch-Case Optimization

Mapped random numbers to game choices via switch-case for readability.
